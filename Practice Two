/*
Practice Two. What's the last value of j here? counter? How many rects get drawn? Calculate manually, then confirm with println
*/

int i = 5;
int j = 10;
int counter = 0;
while (i < 97) {
  j = 10;
  while (j < 97) {
    rect(5+i/2, 5+j/2, 3, 3);
    counter = counter + 1;

    j = j + 10;
  }
  i = i + 5;
}

//We could inculde rect in the println command but it would be easier to get the value of counter.
